## 📘 SQL WITH (CTE) Query Collection

This repository contains my practical SQL work focused on building structured and readable queries using **WITH clauses (Common Table Expressions — CTE)**.

## 📌 Covered Skills

- Writing structured queries using WITH (CTE)
- Designing multi-CTE query flows
- Combining CTEs with JOIN operations
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX)
- Proper use of GROUP BY and HAVING
- Analytical and reporting-style queries
- Handling duplicates using DISTINCT
- Replacing complex subqueries with CTE-based design
- Multi-table data analysis and aggregation

## 📂 Sample Data Models Used

Queries are written against typical relational structures such as:

- Employees
- Departments
- Projects
- Assignments 

## 🎯 Purpose

To develop strong SQL query design practices and improve multi-step data retrieval and aggregation techniques using `CTE` based approaches.

## 🛠 Technologies

- SQL (T-SQL compatible)
